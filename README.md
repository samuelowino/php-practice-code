PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development.
These are code samples put together in my journey to grasp  the now Object Oriented Scripting langauge

## Disclaimer⚠️
These samples are focused on plain PHP therefore no frameworks or none PHP-STL tools are included.

## Experiments 🔬
*Procedural PHP*:
Development with plain old top-down php, demonstrating basic language features such as **Type System, Expressions, Functions, References etc**

*Object Oriented PHP*: 🎄
Development with object oriented programming style, that involves introcution of **Classes, Objects, Abstraction, Inheritance, Interfaces and other OOP concepts**

## Design Patterns 🛫
A look at how one can implement industry accepted design patters such as **MVC, Factory Design Pattern, Singletones and Prototypes and so on**
This is done via an embedded sample application;- **Nebula Note Taking App for Astronounts in Space**🧑‍🚀

## Project/Dependencies Management👨‍💼👩‍💼
A look at dependency management via **Composer** to take advantage of extended PHP STL by third party vendors.
